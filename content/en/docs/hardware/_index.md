## ESP32 Introduction

HALMET is based on the powerful ESP32-WROOM-32E microcontroller module. The ESP32 is a dual-core microcontroller with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The ESP32 is a popular choice for IoT applications due to its low cost, good set of peripherals, and ease of use.

## Board Functional Blocks

Different functional blocks of the board are described below.

Functional blocks of the HALMET.

1.  NMEA 2000 and power input and protection. The NMEA 2000 connector has the
    following protection elements:
    - 500 mA self-resetting fuse
    - Reverse polarity protection diode
    - Overvoltage and ESD protection TVS diodes
    - Two-stage noise filtering

2.  Power supply. A switching power supply with a maximum output current of 2 A.

3.  CAN transceiver for NMEA 2000. RX and TX LEDs are included to provide a
    visual indication of CAN bus activity.

4.  I2C and 1-Wire interfaces for connecting additional sensors.

5.  User interface. A reset button, a boot-mode/general-purpose button, a red power
    LED, and a blue user-programmable LED.

6.  USB 2.0 interface for programming and debugging.

7.  ESP32-WROOM-32E module with built-in WiFi and Bluetooth. The module on the HALMET
    board includes 16 MB of flash memory.

8.  Galvanic isolation circuitry for the digital and analog inputs.

9.  Analog inputs. The board has four analog inputs with a 16-bit resolution and
    a maximum input voltage of 33 V. Each input has an under-voltage and over-voltage
    protection and low-pass filtering with a cutoff frequency at 160 Hz to reduce
    measurement noise.

    The analog inputs have an optional 10 mA constant-current source for active
    resistance measurement.The constant-current source can be enabled using the
    CCS jumper headers.

    In resistance measurement mode, the maximum resistance that can be measured
    is 320 ohms.

10. Digital inputs. HALMET has four digital inputs with a maximum input voltage of
    +/- 30 V. The inputs feature a Schmitt trigger to improve noise immunity.


## Galvanic Isolation

The board has galvanic isolation between the digital and analog inputs and the
ESP32 microcontroller. The isolation is achieved using digital isolators for
I2C and the four digital inputs, respectively, and an isolated DC/DC converter
for powering the isolated section.

Due to the provided isolation, the board can be powered from the NMEA 2000 network
without the risk of ground loops. The isolation also provides protection against
voltage spikes and noise on the inputs.

### Top Side Connectors

1.  NMEA 2000 connector. The connector is a 4-pin Phoenix MC 3.81 compatible pluggable
    terminal block. The connector is used for connecting the board to a NMEA 2000
    network and for powering the board.

2.  1-Wire header connector. The 1-Wire header can be used to connect 1-Wire sensors
    to the board. The connector is a 3-pin 2.54 mm pitch header. The header is not
    installed on the board by default because it can interfere with enclosure panel
    connector placement.

3.  I2C header connector. The I2C header can be used to connect I2C sensors to the
    board. The connector is a 4-pin 2.54 mm pitch header.

4.  Micro USB connector. The connector is used for programming and debugging the
    board.

5.  Unpopulated pads for the reset (EN) and boot (IO0) signals.

6.  GPIO header. The GPIO header is a 2x10 pin 2.54 mm pitch header. The header
    breaks out available ESP32 GPIO pins and can also be used as a JTAG header.

7.  Isolated area power header. The header can be used to power external devices
    from the isolated section 3V3 and GND.

8.  Jumper header contacts for the constant-current source (CCS) for the analog
    inputs. The constant-current source can be enabled by shorting the jumper
    contacts.

9.  Analog input connectors. The connectors are 2-pin Phoenix MC 3.81 compatible
    pluggable terminal blocks. The connectors are used for connecting analog sensors
    to the board.

10. Digital input connectors. The connectors are 2-pin Phoenix MC 3.81 compatible
    pluggable terminal blocks. The connectors are used for connecting digital sensors
    to the board.

### Bottom Side Connectors

11.  CAN terminator solder jumper. The jumper can be shorted to enable the 120 ohm
     termination resistor for the CAN bus. Do not use the termination resistor with
     NMEA 2000 networks.

12.  Low-pass filter solder jumper. The jumper can be shorted to enable a low-pass
     filter on the respective analog input. The filter has a cutoff frequency of
     2.3 kHz. The filter can be used for example for reducing noise ina tachometer
     signal.

13.  Pull-down resistor solder jumper. The jumper can be shorted to enable a 100 kohm
     pull-down resistor on the respective digital input. The pull-down resistor can
     be used to read a normally open switch which is pulled high when closed.

14.  Pull-up resistor solder jumper. The jumper can be shorted to enable a 100 kohm
     pull-up resistor on the respective digital input. The pull-up resistor can be
     used to read a normally closed switch which is pulled low when closed.

15.  ADS1115 I2C address selection solder jumpers. The jumpers can be shorted to
     select the I2C address of the ADS1115 ADC. The jumpers are used to avoid address
     conflicts when multiple ADS1115 ADCs are connected to the same I2C bus. The pads
     can also be used to connect additional I2C devices to the isolated board area.

## Power Supply

The permitted voltage input range on the board is 5-32 V. Typical current consumption
is 90 mA at 12 V with the WiFi module active (corresponds to 1.1 W).

## NMEA 2000

NMEA 2000 is a ubiquitous communications standard used for connecting sensor, control, and display devices on boats and ships. It is based on the Controller Area Network (CAN bus) which is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow devices to communicate with each other without a host computer.

The board complies with the NMEA 2000 standard as long as none of the unisolated
connectors are connected to other ground-referenced devices. For example, a 1-Wire
temperature sensor with a long cable can be used since it does not share a common
ground with other devices. However, connecting an I2C analog-to-digital converter
to the unisolated I2C connector would break the NMEA 2000 compliance.

## Status LEDs

There are two buttons and two LEDs on the HALMET board. The two buttons are labeled Reset and Boot. The Reset button resets the board by pulling the ESP32 Enable pin low. The Boot button is connected to GPIO0 and can be used during device startup to force the module into a download mode. Otherwise it can be used as a regular button input.

The two LEDs are not explicitly labeled. The red LED is lit whenever there is 3.3V power on the board. The blue LED is connected to GPIO2 (the pin commonly used for LED on ESP32 development boards). It can be controlled by user programs to indicate the state of the device.

## 1-Wire

1-Wire is a device communications bus system designed by Dallas Semiconductor, since acquired by Maxim Integrated Products. Although 1-Wire is a slow-speed protocol, supporting only speeds up to 16.3 kbps, it is very simple to implement and can be used over long distances. It is commonly used for temperature sensors and similar simple sensing devices.

The HALMET 1-Wire implementation features ESD and RF noise filtering as well as low-pass filtering to improve network reliability.

Note that the 1-Wire data pin (labeled “DQ”) is physically mapped to GPIO4, so in your program, use GPIO4 for all 1-Wire data.

## I2C

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a very popular synchronous serial communication bus commonly used for interfacing with a number of different ICs. It uses two data wires in addition to voltage and ground.

HALMET uses I2C internally for the ADS1115 analog-to-digital converter. The I2C bus is also broken out to a 4-pin header for connecting additional I2C devices.

The I2C bus is connected to GPIO21 (SDA) and GPIO22 (SCL) on the ESP32. These pins are the default I2C pins in the Arduino ESP32 environment, but different from the default pins on the SH-ESP32.
